  \section intro_welcome Welcome
  Thank you for trying out <i>Belle, Bonne, Sage</i>&mdash;the
  &ldquo;beautiful, good, wise&rdquo; vector-graphics
  library dedicated solely to music notation! See the
  <a href="https://github.com/burnson/Belle">main page</a> for more prose
  about the goals of the project.
  
  <b>Update (June 16, 2013)</b>: <i>The library has moved to GitHub and makes
  use of a new graph format as well as a new version of MICA. Due to these
  changes the code is breaking backwards-compatibility. The old SourceForge SVN
  is still available, but is no longer the active branch of development.</i>

  Quick-start:
  \code
  # Clone the repo:
  git clone git://github.com/burnson/Belle.git

  # Change directory to Belle:
  cd Belle

  # Initialize and update the submodules:
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  # Try making all the examples:
  Scripts/MakeAll
  \endcode
